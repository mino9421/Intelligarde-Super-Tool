# Hi, my name is Mino.
## This was one of my first mini projects. This tool is meant to shorten a parking ticket issuing for dispatchers on-line (phone).
## I have achieved the original goal
##### I would like to pre-fill values in textBox elements on a page that opens from clicking the buttons on the original page
##### the information that will be pre-filled are dates, addresses... some things are static and other are dynamic like dates.
##### I do not demonstrate satisfying good programming practices in my code. However, reading the code can demonstrate the differences of now and then which are astronomical.
