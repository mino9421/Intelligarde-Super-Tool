# Intelligarde-Super-Tool
# I am trying to make a tool that shortcuts some repetitive task for customers.
# I have achieved the original goal, but now new problems and goals plus challenges are rising.
# I would like to pre-fill values in textBox elements on a page that opens from clicking the buttons on the original page
# the information that will be pre-filled are dates, addresses... some things are static and other are dynamic like dates.
# this project has the potential to grow bigger and go official and online.
