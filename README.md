# Hi, my name is Mino.
#### This was one of my first mini projects. This tool is meant to shorten a parking ticket issuing for dispatchers on phone. In fact, this was used in my previous employeers and co-workers.
##### I wanted to reduce my workload and this tool helpped me find addresses quickly (hard coded).
##### the information that will be pre-filled are dates, addresses... some things are static and other are dynamic like dates.
##### I do not demonstrate good programming practices in my code. However, reading the code can demonstrate the differences of now and then which are astronomical.
